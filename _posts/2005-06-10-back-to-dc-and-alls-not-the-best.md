So there I was back in DC again, trying to get around....and man what a hassle! Is this city made for people or monuments? There are simply no good maps that convey no truck zones, and where streets are overpasses, or tunnels or simply don't intersect! I'm beginning to think that hiring a driver just to get you in and out of DC is an excellent idea! It didn't help that after the gig I decided to actually take the chance to stay at the hotel with the rest of the crew instead of driving out of the city. With no idea where I was I left the next morning and ended up an a no trucks freeway due to lack of directions and no clue where I was...I decided to risk it on the freeway rather than risk getting stuck on no truck streets and I made it out safely. Thank God that's probably the last time I will ever drive a truck in DC!
