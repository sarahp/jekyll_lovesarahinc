2012 is a big year of changes for us. After moving on average once a year since we've been married we're finally staying put. We have a second baby coming, and more opportunities for activities than ever before after moving into urban Portland.

After 4 years of running Shomeya we have finally decided that it's not going to slow down sufficiently to catch up on all the deferred maintenance in our home.

### Just the beginning ###
We are redesigning our home, our diets, and our schedules. A big part of this year's success depends on making time for ourselves and our family. With the goal that we have the creative energy to actually do some cool things with our business that before was buried under client stress.

### To be alive ###
We plan to accomplish this by reading tons, learning new things daily, and most of all having the grace to realize that perfection is not really a goal at all. Enjoying life, and not having to numb out from reality is.
