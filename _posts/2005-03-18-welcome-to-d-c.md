So I'm doing audio again. Well I've always done audio, but I'm actually getting to do it during a show. Mixing monitors at a corporate gala with a [classic act](http://www.theshirelles.com/theshirelles.html). I mean real classic. Classic as in my parents even knew who they were. 

Normally our gigs in D.C. tend to be a pain or generally be way way harder than they should be for one reason or another either due to to a crazy load in, crazy setup times, or difficulty even getting the truck in there. This one seemed to be hassle free though. We got our truck inspected before heading into the Regan building, waited a few minutes there, headed to the dock, the freight was nice and close, and the push upstairs was short. I had to take the truck back out to the burbs to our hotel before heading back to the gig. 

I walked into the gig, not really knowing what to think. What I found was all too typical for most of you out there. The stage company was about 4 hours behind, the lighting company was equally behind, and we spent a good bit of time waiting before we could get going on the stage. Plenty of other things to do though. Feeder to be pulled, some video gack to be put together and pulled (we were doing video as well, but no lighting...) and cases to be rolled into place and so on. Then more waiting.

I was kinda excited since this was to be my first time mixing on the monitor rig after adding new crossovers and digital EQ. This was to be a bit of a bust. With an act this age and associated talent, their need for monitors was marginal at best. Vocals and piano, up front, in the sidefills and a little bit of piano and bass all the way around. That's what I guessed, and they never asked me for a single thing all night. 

Amazingly we ended up being the first vendor out of there that night, even with running back to get the truck, and waiting to get on a dock and all. All together a great show, uneventful with a happy client (relatively, I'll explain later) and made good use of our new technology. Oh yeah, we used the DM2k out front for the first time as well. This is how all gigs should be.
