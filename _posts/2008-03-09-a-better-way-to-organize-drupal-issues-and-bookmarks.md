So, I've been having a lot problems keeping track of the [Drupal](http://drupal.org) issues that I want to participate in, and help out with. It seems like everyday, I see at least one issue that I think to myself, &quot;HEY SELF, this has GOT to be in the next version of [Drupal](http://drupal.org)!!&quot; And then I never think about it again until I read the release notes for the next major [Drupal](http://drupal.org) release (6, 7, 14* whatever...). This is not a very effective way to help out. I need to be able to get quick access to a list of [Drupal](http://drupal.org) issues, categorize them, and then view and update those categories quickly.

So, enter [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us). Now many of you up-to-date, hooked on the next-best-thing will be expecting my to discover framsets and cgi counters for the web next. Nay, I have known of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) for many ages, but have never been much of one, for applications on the web, that work better on the desktop. I 'got' it but I didn't 'get' it for personal use until recently.
  
What changed my mind you ask? Enter [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/).
  
**UPDATE:** I think I found a Windows client that is similar. If you use Windows, check out [Delicer](http://www.onecone.com/Pages/Downloads/Download.aspx).
  
Now, when I see an issue that I want to make a note of, I just hit the key shortcut for my 'post to del.icio.us' bookmark, and tag the issue or post with tags that help my sort it later. For example my tags that I use alot are: drupal, active, core, contrib, bug, task, issue, module, myissue (used for issues I have tested, or filed myself).

This may sound great and all, but how does this help me sort through my issues? Like I said before, enter [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/). We're gonna get a few screenshots in here to really help this all make sense.

First, you plug in your [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) account info, and open the program and let it sync with your bookmarks the first time.

Now this may not look like that much but please consider the power of this interface on the desktop. Start with the pane on the left:

<img class="right" alt="cocoalicious tags pane" src="/images/cocoa_tags_0.png" />

This pane, shows all the tags you have made on all your posts, and how many posts you have made that correspond with each tag.

As you can see alot of my tags may not make much sense for normal del.icio.us use, but I think they make tons of sense when you see how I use del.icio.us to track my [Drupal](http://drupal.org) issues and info.

Click on any of the tags in the list will high light it, and display only posts that match that tag in the list pane on the upper right. Very cool.
  
Even cooler, you can command-click on multiple tags, and you'll get a list on the upper right, of only posts matching all the selected tags. This is a rather primitive matching, as there is no operator selection other than the AND that is default for multiple selections. This is why I find it easier to break tags into the smallest possible elements, and then filter on those, instead of trying to exclude a set of posts from a larger set.

There are also 3 other tags shown, which are oddly ***, ****, and *****. No, I do not have that much foul language to describe [Drupal](http://drupal.org) issues. Rather, these are star ratings that are built into [Cocoalicious ](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/). When I first started using them, I wondered how [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/) would store my star ratings, and I quickly found out that it was by tags with the corresponding number of asterisks.

When filtering the list of posts, you can sort based on three columns in the list pane, Description, Rating, and Date. I find the Rating to be particularly helpful when I'm sorting through different issues that I want to work on, but can't decide where to start. BTW, please don't go start looking at your issues to see how many stars I've given them. It's just a personal issues for me, and many times based on whether I think it'll be important for projects I'm working on, or whether my skillset matches well with what's needed to help out with that issue.

Here's a view of *active*, *core*, *drupal*, *issue*(s) that I have posted to my del.icio.us account.

Now this helps me keep track of the URLs and keep them categorized and all that. But what about changes? Issues change ALOT. Keeping up with this by clicking each of these links into a browser, and checking that status, and then posting the changes to my del.icio.us account would take forever. Enter the [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/) browser:

![cocoalicious browser pane](/images/cocoalicious_mikey_p.png)

I can get all the status right there in [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/)! Rock on cool Mac app! And the final &quot;Coolest Part Ever&quot; is the info editing. If I see that an issue has been updated, all I have to do is hit command-i and [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/) brings up an edit pane, that lets me re-tag a post right there and quickly move on to the next issue.

So by checking into [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/) a couple of times a day and flipping through the issues list I can keep an eye on the issues I am most interested in. And thanks to this great software I can do it all in a fraction of the time previously involved. Which means big hoorays for [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and world.

I'd love to know if there's a Windows/Linux alternative out there, so please leave a comment if you find something similar, and I'll add a link here.

**Update:** While I haven't tried it personally, **[Delicer](http://www.onecone.com/Pages/Downloads/Download.aspx)** seems to be a similar product for the Windows types.
