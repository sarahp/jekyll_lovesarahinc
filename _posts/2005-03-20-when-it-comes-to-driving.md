I'm now convinced that four wheelers (a term of affection from professional drivers towards those who aren't) just don't get it. I'm sure every other pro driver out there figured this out years ago. I just got it today. It's just like the general public has no clue regarding our profession, the general public has no idea what's going on with the trucks they cut off, curse at, tailgate, pass on the right and otherwise risk their lives around with stupid behavior every day. Yeah, you can tell what kind of day I had. By the way, this came to me driving across *Kansas*.
