>At work, you think of the children you have left at home. 
>At home, you think of the work you've left unfinished. Such a struggle is unleashed within yourself. Your heart is rent. -- Golda Meir

The first time I read this quote I cried. Running a web services business is no small feat even from home. Especially because there's this illusion that working at home on the computer gives you infinite flexibility. Being next to your children at home while working often feels like your doing both your jobs halfway. Your child wants/needs attention and play time, while your project needs review and your client wants a demo. While it's not this way 100% of the time, if there is no break it can start to be overwhelming.

But the world of daycare isn't made for this kind of work. It's difficult to find childcare that occurs outside of the home that is flexible. Nannies are great but who wants to try to keep a 3 year-old quiet so Mom and Dad can work in a cramped 2 bedroom apartment during the long rainy season?

### The reality of cost and time ###
Services income can be so flexible a $1200/month daycare bill is often difficult to maintain 12 months out of the year. This was especially a concern when we moved into the city. Many of the daycares in the city are setup for a 9-5pm year round schedule which is often a far cry from what my hours are during the ebb and flow of projects. Not to mention the long waiting lists for preschool at most places. It's difficult to start out spending so much when you don't always feel like the time you put in working is bringing in enough money to make it worth it.

Evening meetups, end of day launches, and late night coding sprints, are par for the course in Open Source Services work. Scheduling is erratic during the busy season, and slow during the winter months. Sometimes I have to adjust my care requests at a moment's notice depending on when a client pays or last minute work.
 
### Drop-In Daycare ###
[WeVillage](http://www.wevillage.com/) has been a help in both flexibility of payment and scheduling. Being able to take my daughter in at 11am for that client demo after working until 2am is priceless. Being able to bring her home at 4pm when I'm too brain dead to work anymore and just want time with her is even more priceless. <img src ="/images/minnie-mouse-nilit.jpg" alt="Nilit at Preschool" title="Costume Day" class="right"/>Oh and those evening meetups work great with a 9:30pm closing time during the week I can split her time at school on meetup days to keep them from being too long. 

In terms of cost I prepay for a package of discounted hours, but the hours only get marked off when I use them so if things are slow I can stretch them out. Unlike many daycares where if you or your child are sick and miss a day you still have to pay. (Which really stinks when you know your kid is sick from the daycare to begin with.) Those extra hours at the end of the week can get turned into date nights, which is an amazing incentive to stay focused during the week.

Nilit's care at [WeVillage](http://www.wevillage.com/) is exceptional, and most importantly it's home-like. She has consistency with the teachers there, and they work with her unique requests well. Overall it's a more compact environment and Nilit gets time with various age groups which has improved her social skills and confidence. This combined with a great preschool means I don't have to pick her up and take her to daycare after she's done learning which makes it easier to be flexible for clients.

### Working from home is working ###
No matter what your options are regionally it's important to remember that the time you have to work at home is just as valuable as any woman who drives into work everyday. When it comes to your children you have to do what works for you, just don't put off making time for yourself. My daughter enjoys our time together more when I'm calm and can focus on her more completely. Let your kids enjoy their own adventures, and don't be afraid to try different arrangements until something clicks. Some coding parents alternate working hours, or schedule playdates and Grandma time to get in weekly breaks.

This isn't the only childcare method we have tried, but it's the one that has clicked best for us. Sometimes it feels backward to take my child out of the house when I'm just going back home, but surprisingly she loves it. Consequently I get the time I need to actually do that code review and show that demo without having to mute out the sounds of pbs kids in the background. Then when Nilit is home my time is hers...most of the time.
