While I think it's a little designer centric, I like A List Apart's articles, style and I have found them very, very useful in the past, and I'm sure I will again. They are running a survey titled appropriately, &quot;[The Survey for People Who Make Websites 2008](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/survey2008).&quot; I would recommend checking it out.
