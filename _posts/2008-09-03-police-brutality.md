Don't get me wrong, I dislike many of the practices of America's police forces as much as anyone. Many laws that they enforce serve to harass the public, and generate income, but I don't quite get the latest set of outrage at the police for their actions at different riots throughout this country. So the police used tear gas on a crowd of protest/rioters that weren't listening to the police and moving on. This is not news. As much as I don't like it, it's generally a good idea to do what the police say, and some things are bound to provoke them. For instance carrying banners and trying to march through a police line. This applies to &quot;journalists&quot; as well. If you're carrying a palm corder through a protest/riot crowd, then you are not a journalist, and you would be advised to listen to the police as well.
