Tomorrow this site will see some of the first significant activity it has ever seen in it's first year. (wow has it been that long?) I'll be trying to do my best to cover the [NSCA](http://www.nscaexpo.org) show floor and doing my write ups here, especially since the LAB is down at the moment. I'll be trying to post pics from my phone and sending articles in as well, and doing a thorough write up at the end of each day that I am here. 

Commenting on this site is currently not working. If you have any requests of features you'd like me to check out and report on please email me at mike (at) mikeyp.net. That little problem leads me to my next big news...

This site is soon to see some other significant chances as well. Hopefully new software supporting better views and news updating as well as user profiles will be coming soon. I want to be able to post quick news that is better categorized, easier to search, and easier for users to comment on with full forum support for each article. This is taking me a little while to weed through all the different CMSs out there and then adapt whatever I find and set it up for my site. [OpenSourceCMS](http://www.opensourcecms.com/) is a great site to use when looking for possible software.
