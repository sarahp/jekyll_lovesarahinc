Well I won't lie, I get a little chuckle out of the current captcha on groups.drupal.org lately. To be honest I think it could include audio help in the form of this song that I end up singing to myself every time I complete it.

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ect-kgxBb4M"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ect-kgxBb4M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>

And there are [plenty more](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sesame+street+one+of+these+things&amp;search=Search) examples on youtube as well.
