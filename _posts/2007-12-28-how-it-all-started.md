It's that time of my life when I'm sitting back and reflecting on many different things. Like how exactly I got into this business (pick either of them) and what it means now that I'm here. While reflecting on the road to get here many times we seem to forget just how early we get the twinges of will later be our career. Is it as a teen, adolescent, or even a grade school child? Sometimes it could be all of those, or even younger. My parents once told me that I had a tendency to play with anything that resembled rope, or string, or anything of the nature, and pretend that it was a 'cord' that I was using to hook something up. I also used old cardboard boxes, markers and lots of imagination to make control panels for whatever device or equipment I could dream up. This was the start of something before I had even reached pre-school.
  
After that it only exploded. Seen to the right, is a picture of my with my first ever audio mixer. The remote controls for radio cars next to it, were actually setup to control the light switches in the room I was hiding in, to enable me to make my own light and sound show, hidden from view. Surely I was on to something here.

A little later of course, I found computers. A very serious thing for a little technician. Although I was nearly an adult by then, I still found it as the best way to identify myself through my final years in public school. When in high school, I decided to order my 'class ring' as many do, and when asked what to select for the sides, that would describe me, all I could think of was the school mascott, and yes, a computer. Where many of my peers had sports symbols and other noble hobbies, I had adopted what to me was truly the noblest of all, the computer.

I found these moving today, as I was packing up to head to a new place, and while it is fun now, to look back at where I've been, I think it is even more fun to imagine now, what I will look back on, years from now, in amazement, what things I am doing today, that will shape my future.
